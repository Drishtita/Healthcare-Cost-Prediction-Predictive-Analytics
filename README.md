# Healthcare-Cost-Prediction-Predictive-Analytics
Predictive analytics project to estimate annual medical insurance costs using machine learning.
Healthcare Cost Prediction using Predictive Analytics
# Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting annual medical insurance costs using predictive analytics and machine learning techniques. The objective is to analyze healthcare, demographic, lifestyle, and insurance-related factors and build accurate regression models for cost estimation.

# Problem Statement

Healthcare costs vary significantly across individuals due to differences in medical conditions, healthcare utilization, and lifestyle habits. Accurate prediction of these costs can help insurers, healthcare providers, and policymakers make informed decisions.

# Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on healthcare data

Engineer meaningful features influencing medical costs

Train multiple regression models

Compare models using standard evaluation metrics

Identify the best-performing predictive model

# Dataset Information

Type: Healthcare Insurance Dataset

Records: ~100,000

Features: Demographic, lifestyle, clinical, insurance & utilization attributes

Target Variable: annual_medical_cost

Prediction Type: Regression

Dataset sourced from a publicly available healthcare insurance dataset (Kaggle / synthetic dataset for academic use).

# Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook


# Methodology

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Model training:

Linear Regression

Ridge Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Model evaluation using:

R² Score

RMSE

MAE

# Results

Best Model: Random Forest Regressor

R² Score: ~0.95

Healthcare utilization and chronic conditions were the strongest predictors of cost.

# Key Insights

Medical costs rise exponentially with chronic conditions

Healthcare utilization impacts costs more than demographics

Preventive care and early intervention can significantly reduce expenses

# Future Scope

Real-time cost prediction systems

Explainable AI (SHAP) for interpretability

Deep learning models

Integration with hospital management systems
